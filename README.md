# Clinic Workflow Sandbox (Demo)

This project is a synthetic clinic workflow sandbox built to safely prototype and demonstrate clinician productivity tools.

⚠️ This is a demo environment only.
- All patient data is synthetic
- No data is stored, processed, or transmitted
- Not intended for clinical or diagnostic use

## Why this exists
Building tools for healthcare requires care. This sandbox allows experimentation with workflow, UX, and assistive tooling without exposing real patient data or interacting with clinical systems.

## Features
- Synthetic patient dashboard
- Consultation timer
- Free-text clinical notes
- Task checklist
- End-of-consultation flow

## Intended Use
- Demonstrating Chrome extensions
- Testing clinician productivity ideas
- Learning in public about healthcare UX

## Tech Stack
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript (frontend only)

## Next Steps
- Integrate productivity extensions
- Explore assistive (non-diagnostic) AI patterns
